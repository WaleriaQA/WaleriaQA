- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @WaleriaQA

- ðŸ‘‹ My slogan is: Education is the most powerful weapon with which you can change the world.

- ðŸ‘€ I am a manual QA and currently participate in several projects, where we are testing different web and mobile applications. In most cases, we have to do with functional, localization, usability, exploratory, accessibility and voice testing. On a daily basis, I fill out test cases and write bug reports. I am well-organized and detail-oriented. My qualities, such as sociability, flexibility and punctuality make me good at teamwork.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in finding a remote job in a big company because I would like to continue applying all the knowledge, gained during the courses and work.

- ðŸŒ± I enjoy learning new things.
